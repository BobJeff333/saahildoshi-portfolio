              Project RANCH was Oconee County Rocketry Association’s NASA Student Launch vehicle: a 4-inch-diameter fiberglass airframe using removable Delrin fins, redundant avionics, dual-deployment recovery, and the ACORN payload.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work centered on the forward section, where mission instrumentation had to coexist with structural couplers, nose ballast, a 360° camera, recovery operations, and rapid field access. The result depended on controlling interfaces rather than treating the payload as a separate object.
